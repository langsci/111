\BackBody{Sanghoun Song (1977) is specialized in grammar engineering based on the HPSG and MRS formalism. He graduated from Korea University in Seoul, where he earned his BA and MA degree in linguistics. He received a PhD in linguistics from University of Washington in Seattle. Afterwards, he worked at the computational linguistics lab at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore as a research fellow. Now, he is an assistant professor at Incheon National University. His research interests include grammatical theory (the theory of computational grammar from a cross-linguistic perspective), experimental syntax (the use of acceptability judgments as evidence for linguistic theories), and corpus linguistics (the use of data-based methods to capture linguistic phenomena in human languages).}
